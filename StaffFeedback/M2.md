# SwEnt M2 Team Grading Report

The M2 feedback provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on how well your team has applied good software engineering practices, delivered user value, and collaborated effectively. We assessed the quality and maintainability of your implementation, the clarity of your design, and the consistency of your delivery and teamwork across Sprints. An important component is how much you have progressed since the previous milestone. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document. As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

| **Final Grade**                          | **5.02 out of 6**   |            |                                           |

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

---

## Implementation (APK, code quality)

We evaluated your APK’s functionality, stability, and user experience, along with the quality and consistency of your code. We also reviewed your CI setup, Sonar integration, and tests, including the presence of at least two meaningful end-to-end tests and the line coverage achieved.

When first registring, there are some pre-filled values, but it is impossible to actually change them (impossible to save the changes). Detailed filtering for sports activities is not working and it seems like it is not possible to filter on the series (no matter the filter they always appear). Overal the whole filtering mechanism should be re thought. 

The code is overall good, and well documented. 
You should have a look at all the issues pointed at by SonarQube as they are currently piling up and will potentially be a big problem.

The line coverage of the whole application is pretty high (94%), well done! 

You have 2 end-to-end tests, each testing a different user flow quite extensively.

Keep up the good work!

For this part, you received 5.23 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Features

We evaluated the features implemented in this milestone. We looked for the completion of at least one epic, as well as the use of at least one public cloud service, one phone sensor, and a concept of authentication.
We assessed how well the implemented features align with the app’s objectives, integrate with existing functionality, and contribute to delivering clear user value.

The application proposes several features that are implemented and usable, but some have a lot of bugs or don't work as intended. As for example the delete event where the user can still se the deleted event on the map, or the edit profile that does not save. 

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma and Architecture Diagram

We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure. 

The Figma is pretty complete and even contains some design for the upcoming implementations, well done!
The architecture diagram is really complete and presice on every part of the application architecture. We can clearly see an improvement from the one for the first milestone, keep up the good work!
It could have included some of the future implementations you are planning on adding.

For this part, you received 5.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them. We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

The sprint backlog for next sprint is complete and is filled with enough tasks for the next sprint. The majority of the tasks are assigned and have a time estimate. Tasks for which the title might not be enough contains a description further explaining what should be done.
The user stories in the product backlog do not have a priority, which is a good practice as it shows some reflection on what are the most important features for the application, and it helps for the sprint planning.

For this part, you received 5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process (documents, autonomy)

We evaluated your ability to autonomously run and document the Scrum process. We looked at how well you documented your team Stand-Ups and Retrospectives for each Sprint. We also assessed your level of autonomy in organizing and conducting these ceremonies, defining and prioritizing user stories in your Product Backlog, and planning well-scoped Sprint tasks that lead to concrete, valuable increments.

The scrum documents are correctly filled. During the meetings it would be better if the Scrum Master and Product Owner really played their roles and provided necessary input. 
The team is starting to operate with more autonomy during the friday's meeings, but it could still be improved a bit. Try to be really clear in the meeting structure and ensure that you make the most of it by communicating as much as possible about the application, what you want to do, and potential problems you encounter.

For this part, you received 4.25 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Consistent Delivery of Value

We reviewed your team’s ability to deliver meaningful increments of value at the end of each Sprint.  
We assessed whether your progress was steady, visible, and tied to concrete user value and app functionality, in line with your Product Backlog objectives.

Each sprint adds some value to the app.The progress is consistent, and it is clear that the app is developing each week.

For this part, you received 4.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M2 is 5.02/6. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Keep up the good work and good luck for the next milestone!
